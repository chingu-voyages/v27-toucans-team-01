## What I'm Watching

_What I am watching_ (working name) is an app that will allow users to quickly and easily see their viewing history across several platforms. Rather than having to go to each site (hulu, netflix, amazon prime, hboMax, etc), a user can see their viewing history all in one place. Furthermore, users can share their profiles with friends.


We plan to add functionality for logging in and creating persistent profiles.
